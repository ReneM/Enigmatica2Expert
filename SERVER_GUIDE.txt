## Installing

1) Download the zipfile.
2) Extract it to an empty folder.
3) If you want to change RAM usage, Java arguments etc, see the "settings" file.
4) Double click "ServerStart" or "ServerStartLinux", whichever is appropriate.
5) Set EULA=true
6) Pregenerate the world - See below for instructions.



## Updating

1) Backup your world, including config, mods, schematics and scripts folders.
2) Delete the config, mods, schematics and scripts folders from the server.
3) Download server files, note that the Forge version has only changed if specified at the top of the changelog.
4) Extract into an empty folder.
5) Move the config, mods, schematics and scripts from the extracted zip into the server folder.
6) Reapply all changes you have made to the server. I recommend that you keep all changes in a seperate
	folder, so you can just move them over after updating.
	
	
	
## Pregeneration

Run these commands:

Pregenerates a circle of terrain, with radius of 300 chunks, centered on spawn
	1) pregen gen startradius circle 0 0 200

Pregenerates a circle of terrain, with radius of 100 chunks, centered on spawn in the Twilight Forest
Only applicable for modpacks with the Twilight Forest
	2) pregen gen startradius circle 0 0 7 50

This process will take a while, so I suggest you speed it up:
Increases speed drastically
	3) pregen timepertick 250

Allocates most of the servers resources to the pregenerator.
	4) pregen utils setPriority Pregenerator


While the server pregens, no one should play on it.
It can take several hours to finish. When it has completed,
restart the server.
