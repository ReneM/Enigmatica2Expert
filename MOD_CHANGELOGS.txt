			 - Fixed a problem with the screen dump module not working properly in some cases
			 - Fixed a problem with the wireless logic block not correctly sending a block update to the destination block
			 - Fixed the digit logic block not always updating visually
			 - Lykrast maded machines face the user in first person, like pumpkins do. This means you now see the front of the machine instead of the side/back when holding in your hand.

			 - Fixed dropping liquid buckets in the fluid opcodes
			 - Small improvement on error logging. The index of the program card that is causing the error is now also printed

			 - New opcode ('eval_countcrafts') to count the possible number of crafting operations given a card and an inventory
			 - New opcode ('do_vector_sort') to sort a vector
			 - New opcode ('eval_vector_indices') to generate a vector of integers starting with 0
			 - Converting a vector to a string will now give a short summary of its contents instead of just []
			 - New 'length' function which is a more convenient way to calculate the length of a string or vector
			 - The 'do_getingredients_smart' and 'do_getingredients' opcodes now have optional 'oredict' parameters so that you can enable oredictionary support for checking ingredients
			 - New 'watch' commands that can help debug a program by watching when a variable changes. You can then log that change or set the program in debug mode
			 - Added new 'comment' opcode that acts like a wire but has the extra ability to attach three comment lines. This makes it easier to document your programs
			 - New 'test_eq_item' opcode which is a more flexible way to test for item equality. It can optionally use metadata, NBT, and oredictionary to do the equality test
			 - Fixed a problem where opcodes that work with 'numbers' didn't have access to functions that return integers
			 - The 'eval_tuple' opcode now also has a way to get a tuple from a variable
