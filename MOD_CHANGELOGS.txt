	Astral Sorcery (went from AstralSorcery-1.12.2-1.10.18.jar to AstralSorcery-1.12.2-1.10.19.jar):
		AstralSorcery-1.12.2-1.10.19.jar:
			Changes:

			- Make spectral tools not collide with the player

			Fixes:

			- Only create structure matchers for relevant relays

			- Fix perk crashes with dynamism gems

			- Fix visual glitch with translucent blocks

			- Fix recipes being unable to be crafted if the item to be crafted on was manipulated by other means

			- Fix cooldown not being applied for phoenix perk

			- Check for chunks being loaded when running a block search

	AutoRegLib (went from AutoRegLib-1.3-28.jar to AutoRegLib-1.3-31.jar):
		AutoRegLib-1.3-31.jar:

	Better Questing (went from BetterQuesting-3.5.299.jar to BetterQuesting-3.5.300.jar):
		BetterQuesting-3.5.300.jar:
			- Fixed TPS spike when sending large packets such as initial database syncing (only partly. Still plenty of room for improvement)

			- Fixed entity render method not clearing various rotation values such as head rotations

			- Added scroll wheel support for horizontal canvas lists

			- Added WIP test theme that will likely replace the old book-like defaults

			- Changed some networking code in preparation for partial sync rewrites

			WARNING:

			Over the next few builds I will be making some MAJOR rewrites to network handling to finally fix the huge performance issues that have been plaguing large servers for years. This will almost certainly break old expansion compatibility and at times cause desync issues as bugs arise.

			The GUI layouts will also likely be scrapped in the process and replaced with something more resembling an MMORPG (I haven't yet finalised what it will look like yet). Because of all the aforementioned changes I've dropped these builds to BETA status and would not recommend them to be used in major packs releases (build 299 should be plenty stable for that purpose) however I still intend to keep on top of any reported bugs as I rewrite things so feel free to test away.

	Better Questing - Standard Expansion (went from StandardExpansion-3.4.158.jar to StandardExpansion-3.4.159.jar):
		StandardExpansion-3.4.159.jar:
			Fixed right clicking with entity interact task

			Added JEI support to several tasks (yes... I'm sorry it took so long)

			NOTE: Using JEI to looking up items obtainable via rewards won't be re-added due to planned network sync changes. Put simply the client side won't have a complete quest database to search through so there's no point in providing an incomplete response.

	Blockcraftery (went from blockcraftery-1.12.2-1.2.0.jar to blockcraftery-1.12.2-1.3.1.jar):
		blockcraftery-1.12.2-1.3.1.jar:
			Fixed blocks not saving their rotations

			WARNING: Currently glowstone only works on slabs and regular blocks.
		blockcraftery-1.12.2-1.3.0.jar:
			There are a lot of bugfixes in this release. Sorry it took so long to get to this, updates should be more stable now.

			This update was supposed to be much bigger with far more content but will be released over the course of a few updates now to get the fixes out earlier.

			New:

			 * Doors - Both the top and bottom half are customisable
			 * Trapdoors
			 * Pressure Plates - These come in 4 varieties - All, items, players and mobs. Weighted pressure plates are not yet included
			Fixes:

			 * Too many to list, see the closed issues on github instead if you want to know.
